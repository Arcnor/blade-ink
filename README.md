# blade-ink

This is a Java port of inkle's [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink), a scripting language for writing interactive narrative.

**blade-ink** should support pretty much everything the original version does. If you find any bugs, please report them here!

## Getting started

### Loading a json file

First you need to turn your ink file into a json file [as described here](https://github.com/inkle/ink#using-inklecate-on-the-command-line).  Here is an example to load de JSON file in a String:

```
		
		InputStream systemResourceAsStream = ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream(filename);

		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(systemResourceAsStream, "UTF-8"));

		try {
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
			String line = br.readLine();

			while (line != null) {
				sb.append(line);
				sb.append("\n");
				line = br.readLine();
			}

		} finally {
			br.close();
		}
		
		String json = sb.toSTring().replace('\uFEFF', ' ');
```

### Starting a story

Here's a taster of the code you need to get started:

```
		
		// 1) Load story
		Story story = new Story(sourceJsonString);
		

		// 2) Game content, line by line
		while (story.canContinue()) {
				String line = story.Continue();
				System.out.print(line);
		}

		// 3) Display story.currentChoices list, allow player to choose one
		if (story.getCurrentChoices().size() > 0) {

				for (Choice c : story.getCurrentChoices()) {
					System.out.println(c.getText());
				}

				story.chooseChoiceIndex(0);
			}
		}
		
		// 4) Back to 2
		...
```

From there on, you can follow [the official guide](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md#getting-started-with-the-runtime-api). All functions are named exactly the same.
